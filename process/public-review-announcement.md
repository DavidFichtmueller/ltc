# **Public Review Guidance Docs**

## **Instructions posted on the LtC GitHub Repo**

Public Review has begun! The Public Review for the Latimer Core Standard will remain open until January 11th, 2024. Multiple ways are available to contribute during the review period. Please read the following to figure out which is best for you.

### **Note**

Only the[ Normative Term List](https://tdwg.github.io/ltc/terms/index.html) is subject to review. All other documentation, including the[ wiki](https://github.com/tdwg/ltc/wiki/1.-Overview-of-Latimer-Core) and[ resources page](https://tdwg.github.io/ltc/resources/index.html), are non-normative and, therefore, not under formal review. Non-normative documentation aims to improve understanding and clarify normative documentation.
