# Latimer Core
[https://tdwg.github.io/ltc/](https://tdwg.github.io/ltc/)

Latimer Core (LtC) is a data standard for describing collections, proposed by the Collection Descriptions Task Group. It has been designed to support the representation and discovery of groups of items that are encompassed in collections and their subcomponents. The LtC classes and their properties (collectively called terms) aim to represent information that describes these groups of things in enough detail to inform deeper discovery of the resources they contain.

## Public Review
The Public Review for the Latimer Core Standard is planned for December 2023. Multiple ways will be available to contribute during the review period. Please read the following to figure out which is best for you.

> [!NOTE]
> Only the [Normative Term List](https://tdwg.github.io/ltc/terms/index.html) is subject to review.
> All other documentation, including the [wiki](https://github.com/tdwg/ltc/wiki/1.-Overview-of-Latimer-Core)
> and [resources page](https://tdwg.github.io/ltc/resources/), are non-normative and therefore not under formal review. The purpose of the non-normative documentation is to improve understanding and clarify the normative documentation.
